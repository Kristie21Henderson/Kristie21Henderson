## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a machine learning beginner diving into the world of data science by participating in Kaggle competitions. This repository is where I document my learning journeyâ€”sharing notebooks, code experiments, and insights as I practice building models and solving real-world problems with data.

Kaggle provides a hands-on environment that pushes me to apply machine learning concepts in a practical way. From data cleaning and feature engineering to model training and evaluation, each competition helps me strengthen my understanding of the end-to-end machine learning workflow.

I primarily work with Python and use libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Through these tools, Iâ€™m learning how to preprocess datasets, handle missing values, tune hyperparameters, and interpret model performance using metrics like accuracy, AUC, RMSE, and F1-score.

This repository includes my Kaggle notebooks and code submissions, along with explanations of the approaches Iâ€™ve triedâ€”what worked, what didnâ€™t, and what I learned. I also explore data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn to better understand patterns and relationships in the data.

My goal is not just to compete, but to grow as a thoughtful and curious machine learning practitioner. I focus on writing clean, well-documented code and strive to understand the "why" behind every model decision I make.

If you're also new to machine learning or exploring Kaggle, feel free to check out my work, offer feedback, or share ideas. I believe that learning in public is one of the best ways to improve, and Iâ€™m always open to collaboration and conversation.

Thanks for visitingâ€”and hereâ€™s to getting better with every dataset, one competition at a time.
